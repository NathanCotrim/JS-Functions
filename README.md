### Notes üñãÔ∏è 

<p>I was thinking... How all js libs have typing, if the minority of them were coded with Typescript? Researching a little I find that typescript has a resource named declaration, it generates a file with *.d.ts extension about a js file, and in it, all the typing are defined, working same typescript! Because it I decided to recriated Javascript function to explore this feature! OBS: newer functions will being added by time</p>

### Functions I did until now :basecamp:

+ Array.prototype.at()
+ Array.prototype.concat()
+ Array.prototype.filter()
+ Array.prototype.find()
+ Array.prototype.foreach()
+ Array.prototype.map()
+ Array.prototype.reduce()
+ Array.prototype.some()
+ Array.prototype.copyWithin()
